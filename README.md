## Project as a Portfolio

This project has been made public to serve as a portfolio showcasing my development experience. It reflects the skills and expertise I gained during its development.

## Project Status

As of the last known update, the project was functional. However, due to the lack of recent updates and documentation, there is a possibility that it may no longer work as intended.

## Instructions

Unfortunately, comprehensive instructions on how to run the project are not available. The lack of documentation makes it challenging to provide specific steps for setup and usage. Users are encouraged to review the codebase and attempt to understand the functionality if they wish to use or modify the project.

## Future Work

While the project was functional, there were some unfinished tasks or areas that needed improvement. If you decide to revive or enhance the project, consider addressing the following:

- [ ] Autoscrap giveaways
